Hi, I’m Loredaemon — aspiring network wizard, part-time security gremlin, and full-time enthusiast of things with wires (or waveforms).

I’m currently diving deep into the world of networks and cybersecurity.  
That means learning things like **what a VLAN is**, **why trunk ports are awesome**,  
and **how not to accidentally create a routing black hole** (again).

## 🧠 What I Actually Do (Right Now)

- 🛠️ Currently working as a low-level IT technician – yes, I deal with VLANs and trunk ports, but mostly I'm summoned to install Teams and tame possessed network printers.
- 🧷 Preparing for **CCNA** – subnetting, spanning trees, and existential dread
- 🧪 Studying with **Hack The Box Academy** – breaking things legally, I promise
- 🐧 Using **Linux** because it makes me feel powerful (and confused)
- 🍏 Using **macOS** because sometimes I like nice things
- 🎸 Tinkering with gear and **electric guitars**, because tech doesn’t always live in cables

## 🧰 What I Care About

- 📡 Network basics (layer 2 & 3 love)
- 🔐 Cybersecurity – not just hacking, but actual good hygiene
- 📚 Making complex stuff accessible (I believe even your grandma should understand 2FA)
- 🧱 Building a knowledge base with **Obsidian**
- 🧙‍♀️ Weird mix of tech & folklore. Witcher? Yes.  
  _(I read the books before they got cool. Just saying.)_

## 🎮 In Other News

- PC & PS5 gamer. I switch between OSINT and monster hunting regularly.
- I love reading, haunted libraries, old protocols, and weird tech rabbit holes.
- I once explained ARP using carrier pigeons. Nobody asked, but I did it anyway.

## 🧙‍♀️ Let’s Talk If...

- You're learning CCNA and panicking about OSPF
- You think security should be understandable and not just a buzzword
- You’ve ever rage-quit Wireshark but went back like a toxic ex
